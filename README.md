# Predictive-Modeling-for-COVID-19-Infection-Rate-in-OC-CA
In this work, we build a model for tracking the nuances of COVID-19 infection rates in Orange County, CA since January 2020. To that end, we demonstrate the efficiency of a class of gener- alized linear models for time series data using which we can gauge the effect of certain mobility parameters, such as traffic flow in the business and residential areas, as well as mass vaccination rates for predicting the infection rate of COVID-19. We show that when it is utilized for forecast- ing near future patterns, the model does a good job with a high level of confidence
